# k11TechLab Vibium Jest AI Test Framework

A production-style test automation framework for `https://k11softwaresolutions.com`
featuring an AI agent and MCP server integration, built with Jest, Vibium,
structured reporting, Lighthouse auditing, AI-assisted test generation, and GitHub Actions CI/CD.

## Highlights

- Shared Vibium browser setup with reusable page objects
- Coverage across smoke, functional, API, DB, devices, E2E, and Lighthouse
- Timestamped HTML and JSON reports in `reports/`
- AI-assisted test generation with optional OpenAI integration
- AI agent and MCP server integration for tool-driven browser automation
- GitHub Actions CI for API and smoke validation with artifact upload
- GitHub Actions release workflow for showcase bundle packaging
- MIT licensed and production-ready

## Capabilities & Innovations

- **Vibium + TypeScript + Jest:** Tests, shared setup, page objects, and helpers are implemented in TypeScript. Page objects live under `src/k11-platform/pageObjects/`, shared browser lifecycle is handled in `src/k11-platform/hooks/`, and reusable helpers live in `src/utils/`.
- **Mixed-layer automation:** The framework covers smoke, functional, API, DB, device, E2E, Lighthouse, and AI-generated test flows in a single repository.
- **Lighthouse automation:** Lighthouse runs generate HTML and JSON outputs in `artifacts/lighthouse/` for performance-focused validation and demo-ready reporting.
- **DB & API helpers:** Reusable utilities in `src/utils/` support API validation, DB access, and test data handling.
- **AI-assisted test generation:** A repo-aware generator in `scripts/ai/` can inspect page objects, build Jest-compatible Vibium tests, and optionally run them immediately.
- **Prompt and runner ecosystem:** Root-level `prompts/` contains reusable generation goals, and `ai-test-runner/` provides one-click shell, PowerShell, CMD, and npm runner options.
- **Agent + MCP demo:** `mcp-server/` and `agent/` demonstrate how an AI agent can call Vibium-backed browser tools through a real stdio MCP server.
- **Advanced reporting:** Timestamped HTML and JSON Jest reports are written to `reports/`, with screenshots and Lighthouse artifacts captured under `artifacts/`.
- **CI / CD:** GitHub Actions workflows in `.github/workflows/` run validation suites, upload artifacts, and package a release-ready showcase bundle.
- **Clean demo output:** Opt-in debug logging via `K11_DEBUG=true` keeps normal runs polished while preserving diagnostics when needed.
- **OpenAI integration with fallback mode:** The AI generator uses the OpenAI Responses API when configured and falls back to a local repo-aware template when AI access is unavailable.

## Execution Flow

1. Jest starts a suite
2. `setupVibium()` launches the browser and page
3. Tests call shared page objects from `src/k11-platform/hooks/vibiumSetup.ts`
4. Assertions run on live UI, API, DB, or performance flows
5. `teardownVibium()` closes the browser
6. Reports and artifacts are written to disk

## Tech Stack

- Jest for test execution and mixed-layer orchestration
- Vibium for browser automation
- TypeScript for framework, page objects, helpers, and generated tests
- OpenAI Responses API for AI-assisted test generation and the demo agent
- Model Context Protocol (MCP) over stdio for tool-driven agent integration
- Lighthouse for performance audits
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- Python 3.9+
- Vibium runtime and browser dependencies

## Install

### JavaScript

```bash
npm install
```

### Python

```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Run

Run all tests:

```bash
npm test
```

Run targeted suites:

```bash
npm run test:smoke
npm run test:functional
npm run test:api
npm run test:db
npm run test:devices
npm run test:e2e
npm run test:lighthouse
```

Run the CI suite locally:

```bash
npm run test:ci
```

Run legacy Vibium demos:

```bash
npm run vibium:k11:async
npm run vibium:k11:sync
python scripts/vibium/k11_smoke.py
```

## Agentic MCP Demo

Run the Vibium MCP server:

```bash
npm run mcp:server
```

Run the demo agent:

```bash
npm run agent:run -- "Open the K11 homepage and verify the contact page is reachable."
```

See [`mcp-server/README.md`](mcp-server/README.md) and [`scripts/vibium-demo/README.md`](scripts/vibium-demo/README.md) for the MCP and agentic demo details.

## AI-Assisted Generation

Create a starter Jest + Vibium test:

```bash
npm run ai:generate:test -- --page-object LoginPage --goal "Verify valid login reaches dashboard"
```

Generate and run immediately:

```bash
npm run ai:generate:test -- --page-object HomePage --goal "Verify the hero and navigate to services" --run
```

Use preset one-click runners:

```bash
npm run ai:runner:homepage
npm run ai:runner:login
npm run ai:runner:formslab
```

The generator auto-loads `.env` from the repo root if present. Start from
`.env.example` for OpenAI configuration.

See `doc/ai-test-generator.md` for generator details.

## CI/CD

GitHub Actions workflows are included in `.github/workflows/`:

- `ci.yml`
  Runs on push, pull request, and manual trigger. Installs Node and Python dependencies, runs API and smoke suites, and uploads reports and artifacts.

- `release-showcase.yml`
  Runs on version tags like `v1.0.0` or via manual trigger. Packages the showcase framework into a zip file and publishes it as a workflow artifact. On tag pushes, it also creates a GitHub release.

## Reports And Artifacts

Generated outputs are written to:

- `reports/` for timestamped Jest HTML and JSON reports
- `artifacts/screenshots/` for UI screenshots
- `artifacts/lighthouse/` for Lighthouse HTML and JSON outputs

## Documentation

Additional docs are available in `doc/`, including:

- `doc/ai-assisted-test-automation.md`
